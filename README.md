🧠 From neurons to bits (it's all about networks...)

- 👋 Hi, I’m Irene!
- 🔬 I have a solid background in Biomedical Neuroscience Research 
- 👀 I’m interested in challenges that combine my two main interests: Coding and Health Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and C++ in 42 Heilbronn
- ❤️ My favourite projects from 42: [FdF](https://github.com/ipuig-pa/02_FdF) and [miniRT](https://github.com/ipuig-pa/04_miniRT)
